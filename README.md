# moore-s_law
Like using smooth gadgets like mobile phones, laptops with high speed accuracy and precision... It's due to accumulation of large number of transistor in smmallest space 
possible. And here comes Moore's Law.

Moore's law is the observation that the number of transistors in a dense integrated circuit (IC) doubles about every two years. Moore's law is an observation and projection of a historical trend. Rather than a law of physics, it is an empirical relationship linked to gains from experience in production.Though it's a dying law but it's significance has pushed us to build from earliest large computers to small devices as mobile which can be held in palm of hands.

This is output of observed vs predicted Moore's law.

This is output of transistors on chip during all these years.
